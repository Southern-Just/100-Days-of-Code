**upskilling C++** ...
Southern Just here! 👋 So, I've dabbled in programming before, maybe not with the most structured plan, you know? 😅 But now, I'm really aiming to level up! 💪 committing a solid 100 days to dive deep into C++ and hopefully master a big chunk, if not all of it! 🚀 Plus, I'm excited to see how this journey helps me grow personally too, ya know? Seeing something through from start to finish is a victory in itself! 🏆
Let's do this Southern! 💻
